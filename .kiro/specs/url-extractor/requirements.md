# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is a web application that helps users extract URLs from hyperlinked text content copied from various sources like Google Sheets, documents, Excel files, or any text with embedded hyperlinks. The primary goal is to improve work efficiency and reading efficiency by allowing users to quickly extract and manage multiple URLs at once, rather than opening them one by one.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to paste hyperlinked text content into a text area, so that I can see the original formatting with linked text displayed in blue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pastes content into the input area THEN the system SHALL display the content preserving HTML formatting
2. WHEN hyperlinked text is displayed THEN the system SHALL render linked text in blue color
3. WHEN content contains mixed text and hyperlinks THEN the system SHALL maintain the original visual structure
4. IF the pasted content exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL handle large content gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click a "GET URL" button to extract all URLs from the pasted content, so that I can see a list of all embedded links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "GET URL" button THEN the system SHALL parse the content and extract all hyperlinks
2. WHEN URLs are extracted THEN the system SHALL display them in a clear list format below the button
3. WHEN no URLs are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
4. IF extraction fails THEN the system SHALL display "ERROR, PLEASE TRY AGAIN"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage the extracted URLs (copy, delete, modify), so that I can customize the list before taking action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN URLs are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Copy" button to copy all URLs to clipboard
2. WHEN a user wants to remove URLs THEN the system SHALL allow deletion of individual URLs
3. WHEN a user wants to modify URLs THEN the system SHALL allow editing of individual URLs
4. WHEN URLs are modified THEN the system SHALL update the list in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to open all extracted URLs at once, so that I can quickly access multiple linked resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN URLs are extracted THEN the system SHALL provide an "Open All URLs" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Open All URLs" THEN the system SHALL open each URL in a new browser tab
3. WHEN opening multiple URLs THEN the system SHALL handle browser popup blockers gracefully
4. IF some URLs fail to open THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about failed attempts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand how to use the tool, so that I can effectively extract URLs from my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display clear instructions on how to use the tool
2. WHEN instructions are shown THEN the system SHALL explain the step-by-step process
3. WHEN a user needs help THEN the system SHALL provide examples of supported content types
4. WHEN displaying instructions THEN the system SHALL use clear, concise language

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work on both desktop and mobile devices, so that I can use it regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on desktop THEN the system SHALL prioritize desktop-optimized layout
2. WHEN accessed on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL ensure buttons and inputs are appropriately sized
4. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality across all screen sizes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have an Apple-style design with yellow and gray color scheme, so that I have a pleasant and familiar user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use Apple-style design principles
2. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL use yellow as primary color and gray as secondary color
3. WHEN showing navigation THEN the system SHALL use top navigation layout
4. WHEN rendering text and buttons THEN the system SHALL follow Apple's typography and spacing guidelines

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during URL extraction THEN the system SHALL display "ERROR, PLEASE TRY AGAIN"
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages
3. WHEN invalid content is pasted THEN the system SHALL handle it without crashing
4. WHEN errors are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide clear recovery instructions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work in modern browsers, so that I can use it regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed via Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge THEN the system SHALL function correctly
2. WHEN using browser-specific features THEN the system SHALL include appropriate fallbacks
3. WHEN clipboard operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle browser security restrictions
4. WHEN opening multiple tabs THEN the system SHALL work within browser popup policies
